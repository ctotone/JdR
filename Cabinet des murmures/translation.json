This sound is not continuous and punctuates the movements of the body when you direct it.\n\nBy spending 1 perispirit point and moving on Chokmah , you can choose to \"project\" this noise at a distance, within sight. You define the nature of the noise at the moment you obtain this power, it will always be the same.\n\nEXAMPLES: The noise of chains, the rolling of the sea, strange footsteps, the wind in the leaves, breaking glass, children's laughter, etc.",

(You must make a roll in opposition with SENSITIVITY + ROUA'H against ROUA'H to 'reach.)\n\nYou can then ask him for a simple task. The number of perispirit points spent determines the number of words you can use to formulate your order. You cannot ask people to \"die\", but it is possible, for example, to make them \"fall asleep\", \"advance\" towards danger, \"leave\" or, to be precise, \"go home\" .",
"chitine_desc" : "You shape the body to make it more resistant to attacks. It becomes hard like stone, or on the contrary soft like gum.\n\nSpend 2 perispirit points allowed, for the duration of the fight , to roll a die for each wound whose result is subtracted from the damage in addition to the Robustness.\n\nThe effect of the power lasts for the duration of a fight.",
"boite_desc" : "At the cost of unusual contortions, you allow the body to enter a volume much smaller than it, like a chest or a medium-sized box.

Your attempts at intimidation then benefit from a +3 bonus, and your attacks 'a bonus of +1.",

If your roll is successful, the hit points of each part of his body pass beyond the black circle. The GM then chooses whether the NPC remains conscious or not. In all cases, it is weakened.\n\nAny member already injured beyond the black circle is not affected. In the event of failure, you only cause the target to lose two circles of health, chosen by the GM if there are any before the black circles.\n\nThe Spirit converts a portion of the circles of health lost by the victim into points of perispirit: the scale is 1 point gained for 2 circles extorted. If you exceed the number of perispirit points delimited by your gauges, you can distribute additional perispirit points as you see fit to other Spirits.",

"ubiquite_desc" : "As you continue to occupy the Cabinet as a Whisper, you split yourself. This double of yourself then leaves the body of the medium and can move away from it as you wish for the duration of a scene, that he will live on his own and that you will play separately. This second incarnation is immaterial but visible and has your features, during your lifetime. In this form, you can speak out loud, and move in the manner of a normal human being, with the difference that you cross all types of surfaces and you cannot grasp anything. Your consciousness is split and inhabits both your Cabinet form and the exterior double.",
